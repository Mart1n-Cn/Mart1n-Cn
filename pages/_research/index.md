<details><summary>[Abstract]</summary>Based on data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey and Surface Water Quality Weekly Report, we estimate the effects of water pollution, tap water, and their interaction on individual health status. Using the panel IV regression method, we find that water pollution significantly increases the morbidity rate, while ignoring the different levels of pollution exposure caused by the use of tap water may lead to a serious underestimate of the impact of water pollution. Regression results show that tap water can offset about 60% of the negative health effects of water pollution, and the non-offsetting part may come from pollutants that cannot be eliminated by treatment processes in waterworks. Further analysis finds that the long-term health benefits of tap water are one order of magnitude higher than the short-term health benefits, suggesting that sustained water quality improvement has a long-term impact on health. Finally, comparing the disease cost and the total health cost caused by water pollution, we find that nearly 2/3 of the health cost can be attributed to the disease cost. As one of the most important infrastructure investments, the adoption of tap water greatly eliminates the negative impact of water pollution on the health of Chinese residents. This has important general implications for low-income countries with a low proportion of tap water supply.</details>


<li>“<b>Climate Change and The Spatial Distribution of Industries</b>” (with Shuo Li, <a href="https://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/faculty/fulltime/w/240007.htm">Min Wang</a> and <a href="https://csxy.zuel.edu.cn/2019/1104/c7501a227525/page.htm">Xiumei Yu</a>) </li>
<details><summary>[Abstract]</summary>This paper explores the impacts of long-term temperature changes on the spatial distribution of industries, focusing on temperature effects on firm entry and exit. Using the information on all firms registered in China, we find a robust inverted U-shaped relationship between temperature change and firm entry and a significant relationship between high temperature and firm exit. This result indicates that extreme cold or hot temperatures reduce firm entry and increase firm exit. The effects are more significant for large firms and differ across sectors. In response to extreme temperatures, firms may migrate across regions through inter-regional equity investments to create new firms. The long-run projection shows that climate change may significantly reshape the spatial distribution of industries.</details>

<details><summary>[Abstract]</summary>Climate change-induced extreme temperatures threaten agriculture and exacerbate global food insecurity. While the temperature effects on food supply are well-known, we provide the first evidence of short-term fluctuations in extreme temperatures influencing food consumption and nutrition intake in China over two decades. The fixed effect models demonstrate that extreme heat reduces carbohydrate and protein intake without affecting fat consumption, whereas cold weather increases all of them and has a largest effect on fat consumption. Vegetable consumption significantly decreases during extreme heat, while dried legume intake notably increases during extreme cold. In contrast, cereal consumption peaks on hot days and declines on cold days. This paper reveals that air conditioners, fans, and heating systems effectively mitigate the impact of temperature extremes, while refrigerators offer minimal benefits. Thus, biological appetite, rather than food accessibility, primarily drives nutrient intake during extreme temperatures. Besides, rural, low-income, male, and child populations exhibit lower vulnerability. Our study suggests climate change may highly decrease the intake of carbohydrate and protein, but not in the same proportion as fat, offering a novel perspective on the temperature-health nexus.</details>

<li>“<b>Temperature-Dissolved Oxygen Relationship Challenges Water Quality Management Under Climate Change</b>” (with Shuo Li and <a href="https://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/faculty/fulltime/x/239550.htm">Jintao Xu</a>)</li>
<details><summary>[Abstract]</summary>Climate change significantly affects various pollution issues, including water quality. This paper explores the influence of temperature on water pollution indicators using a dataset from almost 150 water monitoring stations in China from 2004 to 2017. The study reveals a dominant correlation between dissolved oxygen concentration and air temperature, significantly affecting the seasonal patterns of water pollution indicators. The paper further highlights the potential bias in water quality assessments due to this temperature-dissolved oxygen relationship, leading to the overestimation of water toxicity in hot environments. The study recommends revising water quality standards to account for this correlation and suggests using dissolved oxygen saturation or concentration as indicators based on the purpose of the water source. The research underscores the crucial role of climate change in water quality management and has significant implications for sustainable development goals, emphasizing the need for integrated solutions. This paper contributes to understanding climate change’s impact on water quality and offers valuable insights for policymakers and environmental conservation efforts.</details>
